# Final Retail Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict retail sales using advanced machine learning models. It leverages historical sales data and a variety of features to forecast future sales, enabling retail businesses to make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer demand.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the raw sales data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant features such as historical sales, promotions, holidays, and more.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to make predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of models using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- **Deployment**: Integration with a dashboard to provide real-time forecasting.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (if you want to run notebooks)
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, mlflow

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Final-Retail-Sales-Forecasting.git
   cd Final-Retail-Sales-Forecasting
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Model Training**:
   Train the model by running the training script.
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   After training, evaluate the model by running:
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. **Deployment**:
   Launch the dashboard to visualize sales predictions.
   ```bash
   python scripts/deploy_dashboard.py
   ```

### Experiment Tracking
The project uses MLflow for experiment tracking. You can start the MLflow UI with the following command:
```bash
mlflow ui
```
This will launch a local instance of MLflow where you can visualize the metrics, models, and parameters of your experiments.

## Model Performance
After training, models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared (R²)**

The model with the best performance is saved in the `models/` directory.
